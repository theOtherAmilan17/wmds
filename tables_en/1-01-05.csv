,Hydrological,Liquid phase,Light absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM),"Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the optically measurable component of dissolved organic matter in water. Also known as chromophoric dissolved organic matter, yellow substance, and gelbstoff. CDOM most strongly absorbs short wavelength light ranging from blue to ultraviolet, whereas pure water absorbs longer wavelength red light.

While used as a variable, the attenuation coefficient is also used as a variable for turbidity. The light attenuation coefficient, k, can then be used in a form of the Beer-Lambert law, I_z/I_0 = e^(-kz) to estimate I_z, the intensity of light at depth z from I_0, the intensity of light at the water surface (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secchi_disk, 2021) (http://hydro.geodab.eu/hydro-ontology/concept/90).",Physical,Optical,Water quality,Metal,,,,,,
